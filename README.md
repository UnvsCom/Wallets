**COMPILED DESKTOP WALLET RELEASES**
------------------------------------

This folder contains our compiled Windows 32bit Wallet & Linux Wallet releases.

These have all dependancies compiled within, therefore should run as normal without any additional dependancies being required on your system, apart from Linux QT runtime being required (see below).

**FOR WINDOWS 32BIT WALLET:**

Install and allow through firewall if prompted.

**FOR LINUX WALLET:**

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run the UNVS-Qt wallet program. On Debian or Ubuntu enter via terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install libqtgui4
```
