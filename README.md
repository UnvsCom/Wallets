**COMPILED DESKTOP WALLET RELEASES**
------------------------------------

This folder contains our most recent compiled Windows 32bit Wallet & Linux Wallet releases.

These have all main dependancies compiled within, therefore should run as normal without any additional dependancies being required on your system, apart from Linux QT Runtime being required (see below).

**FOR WINDOWS 32BIT WALLET:**

Install and allow through firewall if prompted.

**FOR LINUX WALLET:**

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run the UNVS-Qt wallet program. On Debian or Ubuntu enter via terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install libqtgui4
```

Both Wallets should auto sync via the hardcoded IP nodes and DNS Seeders. Do not add random untrusted IP nodes manually to speed up syncing! Only add our official IPs stated on our website at Unvs.com/Wallet.
