COMMUNITY NOTICE!


Firstly apologies for lack of updates as we have been super busy repairing / rebuilding at our end and didn't have much time or headspace for live updates on socials etc.

1) One of our Devs pushed an important update that knocked us completely offline (it was mayhem on our office !).


2) During our attempts at getting back online, we also noticed a few bugs and had to modify patches for them, which took a few hours longer than expected, so dragged our our pain and panic. This included discrepancies noticed in chain data upon full analysis.

3) While we were liaising with our potential VC in regards to our downtime, they suggested that we highly consider and utilize the restart opportunity to create a pre-mine to issue to potential VCs in return for funding. Otherwise our project wouldn't be long term sustainable without their financial backing, nor would it be appealing to them (which is the only way it can thrive for the community to enjoy). We believe they are correct unfortunately and due to such we have had to also implement a pre-mine of half the supply. The remaining supply is in the community hands to mine, so we have met in the middle. We expect approx between 25-35% of all coins will go to these VCs during numerous rounds and these will come from this pre-mine supply. The remaining will be for a dev treasury to cover future operational and expansion costs.


- RECOVERY FUND IN PLACE - 

NEXT STEPS IF YOU ARE STILL HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY!

DOWNLOAD OUR NEW WALLET BUILDS AND FULLY REINSTALL. REMOVE YOUR '.UNVS' WALLET FOLDER FROM YOUR SYSTEM!). THIS IS A NEW GENESIS / BLOCKCHAIN, SO ALL BALANCES WILL START AT ZERO. Old wallet data locations are listed on this git guide of ours: https://github.com/UnvsCom/unvs/blob/v1.4/WALLET-RELEASES.md 

TO ADDRESS ANY PREVIOUS MINERS. WE HAVE THE TOTALS THAT WERE MINED SUCCESSFULLY BEFORE THE OUTAGE (around 350K UNVS were mined). WE ASK YOU DO THE FOLLOWING:

1) SCREENSHOT YOUR WALLET BALANCE BEFORE UNINSTALLING.
2) WHEN YOU REINSTALL THE NEW WALLET / CHAIN, COPY YOUR NEW WALLET ADDRESS. 
3) EMAIL US WITH YOUR NEW WALLET ADDRESS AND THE SCREENSHOT OF YOUR PREVIOUS BALANCE FOR A CREDITING TO YOUR NEW WALLET. Send to: e@unvs.com

WE WILL WORK THROUGH MATCHING THESE WITH THE CHAIN ANALYSIS DATA


We really apologize for this, but in a way glad that we have a reset as we weren't aware of the bugs that were present and this also brought them to light.


And finally.. It was the first few hours of launch and we are highly experimental, so we expected a few obstacles on our journey to running smoothly. Remember your still early coin accumulators, so don't feel disappointed as we are positioning this to make sure it is as successful as we can make it for the community.


The new wallet version is V1.4

We also have a new IP node which is embedded in the wallet for auto sync but this new node IP is stated on our website and wallet download section on git.

We haven't had sleep in 36 hours now as we had to work through last night, so we will be back online for questions shortly. It should all be super stable now, Enjoy, if you start mining !
